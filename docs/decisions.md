# Decisions

Read before an important decision. Update in the same PR.

## ADRs

Generated from `docs/adr/*.md` by `scripts/generate-adr-index.sh`. Don't hand-edit the table; add/rename an ADR file and re-run the script. CI fails the PR if this is stale.

## Standing decisions

- Update by `Id`, never by business key ([#32](https://github.com/JTMoo/StockManagement/pull/32))
- Cultures: de-DE, en-US, es-PY; all UI text via resources
- Import: code repeated in one file → keep first, rest reported as duplicates (owner, 2026-09-24)
- Resources split per domain (`StockManagement.Language/{Common,Auth,Settings,Customers,StockItems,Invoices,Import,Users}`) to cut merge conflicts; each domain is its own resx set + hand-written Designer.cs class, same as `Numbers` (owner, 2026-09-26)

## Open

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| Sequential numbers | `$inc` counter / `Max + 1` |
| `#region` + banners in new code | keep / drop |
| Nullable warnings as errors | yes / no |
| Format check in CI | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` + `.editorconfig` naming rules / none |
